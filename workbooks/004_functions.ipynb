    "# Functions\n",

    "Functions are something we've been using all along, they allow us to write a generic block of code that can be reused for all kinds of different purposes. If we write code to add tax to a sale, combine first and last names, or convert between inches and cm, the actual functionality of that code is always the same, just with different details, or inputs. A function allows us to write all the generic code that is ready to accept inputs, does it's job, and spits out an output. \n",

    "## Defining Functions\n",
    "\n",
    "Creating a function is pretty simple, there are a few things we need to think of:\n",
    "<ul>\n",
    "<li> Function name - as with variables, we want a name that makes sense. The name can be almost anything, but we want it to make sense. </li>\n",
    "<li> Inputs/Parameters - these are the values that are supplied by the person <i>using</i> the function.</li> This changes (potentially) every time the function runs. \n",
    "<li> Body - the code that we want to reuse over and over.</li>\n",
    "<li> Output/Return Value - this is the value that the function \"returns\" or the end result. Not every function needs to return a value, some just do stuff. </li>\n",
    "</ul>\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, if we have a function to add the tax to a price, or parts break down as:\n",
    "<ul>\n",
    "<li> Function name - addTax. </li>\n",
    "<li> Parameters - the price of the object and the tax rates. These things can change to anything. </li>\n",
    "<li> Body - calculate the tax and new price. </li>\n",

We'll look more at scope later, but the basic loops are a good direct example of this. Scope refers to where a variable exists. For most of the random variables we've declared so far, they exist everywhere in the notebook. For example, if we declare a variable in a cell, we can use it in any other cell.\n",
    "\n",
    "Inside the functions we create, we can declare variables that are only available inside the function. This is a good thing, it means we can use the same variable names inside functions without worrying about them conflicting with other variables. In essence, the innards of the function are a separate world from the rest of the notebook. \n",
    "\n",
    "#### Scope Levels\n",
    "\n",
    "We can define the different scope levels as:\n",
    "<ul>\n",
    "<li> Global - these variables are available everywhere in the notebook. Things you declare \"outside\" of any functions are global. </li>\n",
    "<li> Enclosing - if we have nested functions, things on the outer layers are available on the inside, but the reverse is not true. </li>\n",
    "<li> Local - these variables are only available inside the function where they are declared </li>\n",

When our code is looking for a variable, it'll work from the inside-out, or bottom up on out list - it will look to local, then enclosed, then global to find a variable. We can reuse variable names in different scopes without worrying about them conflicting, but we should still consider if it makes sense logically. It is common for us to reuse variables in different scopes from function to function, especially generically named ones like loop counters or parameters. We should be careful of overlapping names where the scope resolution can conflict - for example, the image above the reuses x works, but is hard to understand. "

    "## What to do in a Function?\n",
    "\n",
    "Where, why, and when should we use functions? The answer is pretty simple, whenever we have a block of code that we want to reuse. More aggressively, if we have a specific thing we want to accomplish, we can write a function to do it. Placing our code into functions is never strictly necessary, but it's usually a good idea for a few reasons:\n",
    "<ul>\n",
    "<li> It makes our code more readable. Rather than having all details, the main portion of our code can have higher level abstractions - e.g. \"len\" rather than code that counts the number of letters in a string. </li>\n",
    "<li> It makes our code more reusable. If our code is in a function, we can easily use it in many places with little effort. </li>\n",
    "<li> It makes our code more modular. Individual functions can be added, removed, rearranged, or replaced without impacting the rest of the code. </li>\n",
    "<li> It makes our code more testable. We can verify that a function does what it does, then trust in that when creating larger applications. </li>\n",
    "</ul>\n",
    "\n",
    "It is possible to write code that does everything in one big block, but it's not a good idea. It's much better to break things down into smaller pieces that are easier to understand and test. It is a good rule of thumb to put anything that we might want to do more than once, anything that requires many steps to do one \"thing\", or anything with a defined input and output into a function. You'll rarely go wrong by putting code into a function."

If we figure out some code to perform a calculation or print a set of charts we can wrap that code in a function to allow us to repurpose it - we can perform the same calculation with any set of values, or print charts from any set of data. As well, as our functions get more complex, functions allow us to only write the complex part of our code once, so if we ever need to modify it or correct some error, that change applies everywhere the function is used and we don't need to hunt down multiple corrections. \n",

We can also put our own functions in a python (.py) file that is in the same folder as our file, and import that; I've made the tax function above into addMyTax in the helper.py file. \n",

    "When using some larger libraries that have many types of functions, it is common for us to only import certain parts or packages from a larger library. This will be very common with the large data science packages, and is fairly common in examples online where things are imported. For example, sklearn is a very common data science library that we'll use all the time later on, it has many packages inside it to do different types of things. For example below, I imported the \"metrics\" package only from the sklearn library, then used the \"accuracy_score\" function from that package.
